This a set of scripts and configuration files used for Linux/GNU systems to
provide ease-of-use for common tasks, such as:
  * manage windows/monitors (e.g., switching, tiling)
  * process/generate markup files (e.g., TeX, ASCIIDoc, dot)
  * run programming scripts (e.g., MATLAB, SAS)
  * NVIDIA graphics power management (for Optimus-enable laptops)
  * screen/window recording
  * keyboard bindings
  * and others

These were created for LXDE environment to help for office work and software development.
The collection of scripts found in the bin/ folder are written in bash, Python3, and Perl5.
Shell scripts follow a similar structure but are not currently POSIX compliant (eventually).
The .config/ folder has configuration files for Openbox (window manager) and LXTerminal.
The Openbox configuration uses custom keybindings to invoke the collection of scripts.
A manual for the keybinds is included in the bin/keybinds/ folder.
GNU screen, tmux, and vim configurations are also provided.

Some scripts and configuration files require software dependencies to be met:
  * xdotool, wmctrl, xwininfo, xprop, xrandr
  * pcmanfm
  * pacmd
  * ffmpeg
  * rdesktop
  * NVIDIA drivers, bumblebee, optirun, primusrun
  * pdflatex, bibtex, dot, dot2tex, asciidoc, a2x, ps2eps, epstopdf
  * matlab, sas
