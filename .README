Linux Config
============

This a collection of scripts and configuration files used for GNU/Linux systems
(based on LXDE/Ubuntu) to provide ease-of-use for common tasks, such as:
  * manage windows/monitors (e.g., switching, tiling)
  * process/generate markup files (e.g., TeX, ASCIIDoc, dot)
  * run programming scripts (e.g., MATLAB, SAS)
  * NVIDIA graphics power management (for Optimus-enable laptops)
  * screen/window recording
  * keyboard bindings
  * and others

These were created with the idea of minimizing mouse usage and increase productivity
in personal tasks, office work, and software development.
Scripts are written in bash, Python3, and Perl.
Shell scripts follow a similar structure but are not currently POSIX compliant (coming soon).
Included are configuration files for Vim, gedit, GNU Emacs, GNU Screen, tmux, X,
Openbox, PCManFM, and LXTerminal.
The Openbox configuration uses custom keybindings to invoke user-defined actions
and invoke scripts.
A manual for the keybinds is included in 'bin/keybinds' folder.

Some scripts and configuration files require software dependencies to be met:
  * xdotool, wmctrl, xwininfo, xprop, xrandr
  * pcmanfm
  * pacmd
  * ffmpeg
  * rdesktop
  * NVIDIA drivers, bumblebee, optirun, primusrun
  * pdflatex, bibtex, dot, dot2tex, asciidoc, a2x, ps2eps, epstopdf
  * matlab, sas
  * and others
